# Kinematic Solver For Mac
##Synopsis:
The Kinematic Equation Solver for Mac is a GUI Mac port of the project [Kinematic Equations Solver](https://github.com/kgorgi/Kinematic-Equation-Solver). This project is built using in XCode using the programming language Objective-C. This application solves kinematic physics problems by using the five fundamental variables: displacement, time, acceleration, initial velocity, and final velocity. It can solve for any of the above variables, all is that is required is that the user enter three other variables and select one variable to be solved (which leaves on variable blank).

##Motivation:
This main motivation for this project to learn how to create GUI applications on Macintosh computers in addition to applying the concepts of object oriented programming to a C project which lacks these concepts. Additionally, object oriented concepts used in this project include memory management, inheritance, and using built in exception handling.

##Installation: 
To use the Kinematic Solver for Mac please download and unzip the "Kinematic_Solver_For_Mac.zip" file in the releases tab. Please note that Mac OS X 10.7 or higher is required.
